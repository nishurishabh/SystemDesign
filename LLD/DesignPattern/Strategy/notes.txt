 The vehicle class is the base class which has a drive function user by child vehicle class.
 - The Passenger Vehicle needs the normal drive func defined by the base class.
 - But the sports vehicle needs a special func of drive.
 - Similarly, other vehicles can come in future which might need same or different Vehicles classes.
 - If we keep the base drive func in base class. And other classes override the func, many classes might need the same special drive func, so the code
 will be repeated as code sharing is only possible for the base impl of the drive func.
 - So, the drive function should be under an interface where each class can inject its own version of drive functionality
